YTP Editor (Automatic Ultimate YTP Generator) is an advanced Python-based tool designed to automate the creation of YouTube Poop (YTP) videos, enabling users to generate unique, creative, and humorous video content with minimal manual editing. The tool leverages various video processing effects and algorithms to achieve a YTP-style output.

Overview
The YTP Editor provides a comprehensive suite of features for generating YTP videos by applying a range of effects, transitions, and audio manipulations. It integrates popular Python libraries like MoviePy and FFmpeg to handle video editing tasks, and allows users to customize their video creations through scripting.

Features
Customizable Effects:

Supercut: Compiles various segments of a video into a single sequence, emphasizing specific actions or themes.
Video Remixed/Meme: Combines clips with meme elements, including text overlays and thematic edits.
ArabFunny/Gen Alpha: Adds vibrant or culturally specific overlays and backgrounds.
Parody: Introduces exaggerated elements and humorous audio.
Vidding: Applies various video edits such as color corrections and speed adjustments.
Dance: Incorporates dynamic text and visual effects to mimic dance movements.
Audio Manipulations:

Stutter Loop: Repeats frames to create a stuttering effect.
Ear-Rape: Increases audio volume drastically for humorous effect.
Bleep Censors: Replaces parts of the audio with bleep sounds for censorship.
Video Transformations:

Scrambling/Random Chopping: Randomly chops and scrambles video clips.
Stare Down/Mysterious Zoom: Gradually zooms in on subjects for a mysterious effect.
SpaDinner: Adds surreal overlays and background elements.
Text and Visual Overlays:

Quirky Text Overlays: Adds random and humorous text elements to the video.
Vibrant Color Shifts: Applies intense color manipulations for a striking look.
Installation

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ytp-editor.git
cd ytp-editor
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Prepare Your Video: Place your input video file (input_video.mp4) in the root directory of the project.

Configure Effects: Edit the effect scripts located in the /effects directory to customize the parameters and effects according to your preferences.

Run the Editor: Use the main script to apply all selected effects to your video:

python combine_all_effects.py
This will process your input video through various effects and generate the final output.

Review the Output: The resulting video will be saved as final_output.mp4 in the root directory.
